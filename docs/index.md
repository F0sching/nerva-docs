# Welcome to the NERVA Wiki

This wiki is an unofficial collection of guides for newcomers to the NERVA Project.  
If this is your first time hearing about NERVA, we recommend starting with the [NERVA website](https://getnerva.org).

## What is NERVA?

NERVA (XNV) is an untraceable and secure cryptocurrency aiming to be GPU and ASIC resistant via the new Cryptonight Adaptive POW algorithm. 

The algorithm changes dynamically each block. This means that no ASIC can ever be produced to mine NERVA and it becomes exceedingly difficult to create GPU based mining software to mine NERVA. Since ASICs and GPUs can not mine the coin, it also becomes an unattractive option for mining rental services such as NiceHash.
