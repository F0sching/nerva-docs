# Welcome to the NERVA Wiki

This wiki is an unofficial collection of guides for newcomers to the NERVA Project.  
If this is your first time hearing about NERVA, we recommend starting with the [NERVA website](https://getnerva.org).

## What is NERVA?

NERVA (XNV) is an untraceable and secure cryptocurrency aiming to be GPU and ASIC resistant via the new Cryptonight Adaptive POW algorithm. 

The PoW algorithm changes dynamically each block which makes it more difficult to produce an ASIC to mine NERVA. The changes in PoW each block also make it more difficult to create GPU based mining software to mine NERVA. As the coin is resistant to ASIC and GPU mining it is an unattractive option for hashrate rental services such as NiceHash.
