# Getting Started with NERVA

## What is NERVA?

NERVA (XNV) is an untraceable and secure cryptocurrency aiming to be GPU and ASIC resistant via the new Cryptonight Adaptive POW algorithm. 

The algorithm changes dynamically each block. This means that no ASIC can ever be produced to mine NERVA and it becomes exceedingly difficult to create GPU based mining software to mine NERVA. Since ASICs and GPUs can not mine the coin, it also becomes an unattractive option for mining rental services such as NiceHash.


Below is essentially a checklist of tasks you have to do to get started with NERVA.
