# Start Mining NERVA

Mining is essentially the process of using your computer to help verify and secure a cryptocurrency network, in our case, it is the NERVA network. By doing this, you will be rewarded with some NERVA.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!

**Please note:** Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.

There are currently a few different ways in which you can start mining NERVA:

### 1. [Solo-miner](https://getnerva.org/#downloads)

The solo-miner is in-built into the core software, letting you check your balance and mine at the same time.  
Please know that you can only mine with *your CPU* on NERVA, and *cannot* use your GPU to mine NERVA

Please follow [this guide](../Solo-Miner-Guide) to start mining NERVA.

If you're on Linux, check [this guide](../Solo-Miner-Linux-Guide).

### 2. Cloud Mining

Please follow [this guide](../Cloud-Mining) to mine with the cloud.

### 3. Mobile Mining

**Please note:** Using your mobile to mine NERVA is not very effective and should only be done for the lulz. It may also cause the phone to overheat and result in premature silicon degradation, shortening the lifespan of your phone.

Please follow [this guide](../mobile-mining/Mining-with-Phone) to mine with your mobile phone.
